Security:
    facebook is only accessed to get the oauth token, which is only used to authenticate with tinder
        as of version 0.99.13
        future versions may also access facebook to display the "connections" that the tinder
            app displays
    some releases of this software are mangled
    the portions that communicate with tinder and facebook are left un-mangled so they can be inspected
    originally the portion that manipulates data was mangled using uglify.js
        this was to discourage abuse of the tinder api
        but tinder tolerates 6tin and flamite, so this mangling has been dropped
        please use this tool responsibly (ie tinder may block you if you don't)
